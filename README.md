# Arduino-IoT.SmartHome
This is IoT Smart home based ATmega328 project. The project perform many functions and able to be developed and increasing.
This project is based on Real Time Operating System (RTOS). But arduino cannot handle RTOS good so it is called Multi Tasking with effiecent delay.
This code is under developing. I am working to add new features and advanced coding algorthims to make the system more smart and effiecent.
