# Arduino-IoT.SmartHome
This is IoT Smart home based ATmega328 project. The project perform many functions and able to be developed and increasing.

I made this project to start my career in Inernet of Things design.
This system can do many things (multitask) at same time in effiecent way. 
I am still working on upgrading it Hardware and Software and adding new algorthims to get the smart home smarter.
